# MS_Access_DSN_Less
An attempt for an Access .Net Com Add-In to easily setup DSN Less connections

VBA code for making a DSN-Less connection is easy to find on the web, but you always have to copy the executing code to a module and use it from there.
Wouldn't it be great to create those DSN-Less connections from a managed com addin? I'm used to work with https://www.add-in-express.com, so I'l think I'll use it again for now. 

But to be honest this is just my first repository for taking my first baby github steps.
